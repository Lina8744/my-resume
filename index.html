    <p><h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>I have ever loved to learn, to get new experiences and insights into the thoughts from others. I like to analyse, whatever it is, processes, products or social situations. Now I`m excited to live my enthusiasm to help making things easier through learning web development and UX design. My background being a mechanical engineering technician with additional qualification in technical business administration with experience in purchasing helps me to look at projects with the financial and technical glasses.
